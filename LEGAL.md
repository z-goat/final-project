Legal guidance — Harvard-themed styling (informational)

1) Official marks and crest
- Do NOT use Harvard's official crest or wordmark without permission from Harvard University.
- Using official marks in public or commercial projects can infringe trademark or licensing requirements.

2) Recommended safe options
- Option A (Safe): Apply a Harvard-inspired color palette (crimson) and fonts without using the crest or wordmark.
- Option B (Safe): Use a stylized, original shield or badge (as created here) and label the app clearly as "Unofficial" or "For alumni".
- Option C (Requires permission): Use Harvard's official crest/wordmark only after obtaining explicit permission and following brand guidelines.

3) Copy and labeling
- Include a clear "Unofficial" or "Independent project" note in the footer if the project is not affiliated with Harvard.

4) Attribution
- If you borrow any assets, keep track of source and license; include attribution where required.

5) When in doubt
- Contact Harvard's brand/legal office for explicit guidance if you plan to publish or distribute this app externally.

Selected option: Option A — color-only theme applied. The project now uses Harvard-inspired colors and fonts only and does not include crest or shield imagery. A clear "Unofficial" label is shown in the UI.
